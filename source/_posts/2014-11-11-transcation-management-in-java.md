Recently I encountered a great number of topics with transcation management whatever in a interview or web application. 

* How to handle read-write splitting?
* How to handle transcation in distributed system, i.e. distributed transcation?

There are lots of Java solution in the wild, e.g. Spring transaction, Java Transaction API (JTA), JDBC, Hibernate, Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Data Objects (JDO).
