Today I received a new task that they wanted me to be familiar with the whole business logic chain, so I started to use UML usecase diagram to represent the relationship. Actually I used to draw class/sequence diagrams via Jude, at this time I investigated couples of [UML tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools) that can easily work both on Mac and Windows, e.g. astah, ArgoUML, LucidChart, Visual Paradigm. Considering the free licence, I choosed [StarUML](http://staruml.io/) that is free and also works well on MacBook Retina.

Thus, I took [Learning UML 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-UML-2-0-Russ-Miles/dp/0596009828/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414771679&sr=8-1&keywords=uml) as a reference.

There are the most common top 4 useful diagrams, i.e. use case, class, sequence, activity diagram.

Let's get started with use case diagram example. To show your system's boundary on a use case diagram, draw a box around all of the use cases but keep the actors outside of the box.
